2. Stats of time elapsed between 'rdtsc' calls
min: 48: max: 72: mean: 62: stdiv: 4

3. Stats of time elapsed between kernel module 'pmccntr_get' calls 
min: 18, max: 25, mean: 18, stddev: 0 

4. Stats of cpu cycle counts elapsed 
(With kernel included)
min: 4730, max: 46722, mean: 5847, stdiv: 4184

(Without kernel)
min: 126: max: 433: mean: 137: stdiv: 37

5. Stats of time elapsed between user 'pmccnt_get' calls
min: 32, max: 299, mean: 79, stddev: 37

The values reported by the PMU when called from userspace are, on average, larger than the values reported when called in kernelspace.
This is seen by the difference in part (3) where it took on average 18 vs 79 counts.

rmmod: ERROR: ../libkmod/libkmod-module.c:799 kmod_module_remove_module() could not remove 'enable_ccnt_user_522': Operation not permitted

Delete module perms check code:
if (!capable(CAP_SYS_MODULE) || modules_disabled)
		return -EPERM;

Init module perms check code:
err = may_init_module();

*Note: may_init_module() also uses te same delete module perms check code

(2)
Both the checks use the 'capable()' function
